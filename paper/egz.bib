abstract = {Erdös, Ginzburg and Ziv proved that any sequence of 2n−1 (not necessary distinct) members of the cyclic group Zn contains a subsequence of length n the sum of whose elements is congruent to zero modulo n. There are several proofs of this celebrated theorem which combine combinatorial and algebraic ideas. Our main result is an alternative and constructive proof of this result. From this proof, we deduce a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a zero-sum n-sequence of the given (2n−1)-sequence of an abelian group G with n elements (a fortiori for Zn). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient algorithm for finding zero-sum n-sequences.}

    abstract = { Abstract The modular subset sum problem consists of deciding, given a modulus m, a multiset S of n integers in 0.m – 1, and a target integer t, whether there exists a subset of S with elements summing to t (mod m), and to report such a set if it exists. We give a simple O(m log m)-time with high probability (w.h.p.) algorithm for the modular subset sum problem. This builds on and improves on a previous O(m log7 m) w.h.p. algorithm from Axiotis, Backurs, Jin, Tzamos, and Wu (SODA 19). Our method utilizes the ADT of the dynamic strings structure of Gawrychowski et al. (SODA 18). However, as this structure is rather complicated we present a much simpler alternative which we call the Data Dependent Tree. As an application, we consider the computational version of a fundamental theorem in zero-sum Ramsey theory. The Erdős-Ginzburg-Ziv Theorem states that a multiset of 2n – 1 integers always contains a subset of cardinality exactly n whose values sum to a multiple of n. We give an algorithm for finding such a subset in time O(n log n) w.h.p. which improves on an O(n2) algorithm due to Del Lungo, Marini, and Mori (Disc. Math. 09). }
