abstract = {Erdös, Ginzburg and Ziv proved that any sequence of 2n−1 (not necessary distinct) members of the cyclic group Zn contains a subsequence of length n the sum of whose elements is congruent to zero modulo n. There are several proofs of this celebrated theorem which combine combinatorial and algebraic ideas. Our main result is an alternative and constructive proof of this result. From this proof, we deduce a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a zero-sum n-sequence of the given (2n−1)-sequence of an abelian group G with n elements (a fortiori for Zn). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient algorithm for finding zero-sum n-sequences.}
